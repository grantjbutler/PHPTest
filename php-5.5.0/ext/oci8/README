The OCI8 Extension
------------------

Use the OCI8 extension to access Oracle Database.  

Documentation is at http://php.net/oci8

The extension can be built with PHP versions 4.3.9 to 5.x using Oracle
9.2, 10, or 11 client libraries.  Oracle's standard cross-version
connectivity applies.  For example PHP linked with Oracle 11.2 client
libraries can connect to Oracle Database 9.2 onwards.  See Oracle's
note "Oracle Client / Server Interoperability Support" (ID 207303.1)
for details.
