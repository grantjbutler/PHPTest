Embedded Caudium PHP support. It seems to work but isn't tested
much. Due to a design choice it requires _Pike_ threads and a
thread-safe PHP. It doesn't however require _Caudium_ to run in
threaded mode. Due to the design, utilization of multiple processors
should be pretty good.

It requires a new Pike 7.0 and Caudium. It will not work with
Roxen. Also, with the help of the VIRTUAL_DIR code in PHP, PHP
execution should be very similar to that of mod_php or the cgi
script. 

If you have any questions, please contact me, David Hedbor
